# Shoot-The-Block

A 2D mobile game with very simplistic graphics consisting of differently colored blocks. It has a score system and you gain scores by tapping the screen to shoot a bullet that goes straight towards another block which is the target. The player must time their shot however as their are blocks that run sideways on the screen and if you hit them instead of the intended target then it is game over.
